  <!-- List of remote hosts which are allowed to access this agent. The name can be
       given as IP or FQDN. If any of the given hosts matches, access will be allowed
      (respecting further restrictions, though). If <remote> ... </remote> is given
      without any host no access is allowed at all (probably not what you want).

      You can also specify a subnetmask behind a numeric IP adress in which case any
      host within the specified subnet is allowed to access the agent. The netmask can
      be given either in CIDR format (e.g "/16") or as a full netmask (e.g. "/255.255.0.0")
